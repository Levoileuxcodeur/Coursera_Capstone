# Introduction

When moving to a new city, it is difficult to identify which neighborhood suits our needs without already having spent some time in the city.

Therefore, I want to create a tool that will allow users to identify what they like in their current neighborhood and find similar neighborhoods in an other city of their choice.

Typical factors could be: proximity to parcs, amount of grocery stores, diversity of bakery and butcher shops, access to public transit and commute time by car to their favorite getaway location or workplace.

This idea is based on my dream to one day move from where I live to an other city and be able to find a neighborhood that match my lifestyle.

# Data

I plan to use the following sources to gather data:  
-Wikipedia pages regarding neighbordhood description (I plan to take two or three cities to start with)  
-Foursquare data regarding venues of each neighborhoods   
-Google maps api regarding drive time between given locations

I want the user to identify the venue types they enjoy the most in their current neighborhood and identify where they would need to commute to. 

I want the neighborhoods recommendations to be based on a weighting of the user's preferences .
