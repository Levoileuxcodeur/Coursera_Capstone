# Introduction

When moving to a new city, it is difficult to identify which neighborhood suits our needs without already having spent some time in the city.

Therefore, I want to create a tool that will allow users to identify what they like in their current neighborhood and find similar neighborhoods in an other city of their choice.

Typical factors will be amount of: Arts & Entertainment, Food shop, Shop and Service, Outdoor & Recreation & Nightlife Spot. (Those categories are Foursquare top-level categories)

This idea is based on my dream to one day move from where I live to an other city and be able to find a neighborhood that match my lifestyle.

# Data

For this study, I am comparing Montreal and Vancouver, two canadian cities.

I use the following sources to gather data:  
-Wikipedia pages regarding neighbordhood description (I plan to take two or three cities to start with) 
-Foursquare data regarding venues of each neighborhoods :
  - https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api-reference/venues/search/
  - https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/build-with-foursquare/categories/

I want the user to identify the neighborhoods they enjoy the most in Montreal and present choices of similar neighborhoods in Vancouver.

I want the neighborhoods recommendations to be based on a weighting of the user's preferences .
